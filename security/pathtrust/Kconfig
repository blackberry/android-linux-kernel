config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	bool "Pathtrust Support"
	select GLOB
	depends on SECURITY
	default n
	help
	  This select the pathtrust security module which enables mount
	  points to be whitelisted as trusted and enforces limitations on
	  what can be executed/loaded by the kernel.
	  The state of pathtrust can be read from /sys/kernel/security/pathtrust/enabled
	  where the states are enabled(1) and disabled(0) (requires SECURITYFS enabled and
	  mounted). If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_ROOTFS
	bool "Pathtrust whitelist rootfs"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default y
	help
	  This whitelists rootfs in pathtrust at module init time. It also
	  sets the rootfs mount as 'trusted' at kernel init time.
	  Defaults to Y.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_WHITELIST_IMPLICIT
	bool "Consider all devices implicitly whitelisted"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default n
	help
	  Considers all devices whitelisted for debugging
	  purposes on systems where devices may not be whitelisted
	  using the normal process. Defaults to n.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_PATHNAMES
	string "Whitelisted pathnames"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default ""
	help
	  Semi-colon separated whitelist of glob-aware pathnames to match in exec mmap
	  security checks. Full pathnames are matched. Defaults to empty.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_FIRMWARE
	bool "Block firmware loading from anonymous sources"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default y
	help
	  Semi-colon separated whitelist of glob-aware pathnames to match in exec mmap
	  security checks. Full pathnames are matched. Defaults to Y.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_BOOTPARAM
	bool "Pathtrust boot parameter"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default n
	help
	  This option adds a kernel parameter 'pathtrust', which allows Pathtrust
	  to be disabled at boot.  If this option is selected, Pathtrust
	  functionality can be disabled with pathtrust=0 on the kernel
	  command line.  The purpose of this option is to allow a single
	  kernel image to be distributed with Pathtrust built in, but not
	  necessarily enabled. Defaults to N.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_BOOTPARAM_VALUE
	int "Pathtrust boot parameter default value"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_BOOTPARAM
	range 0 1
	default 1
	help
	  This option sets the default value for the kernel parameter
	  'pathtrust', which allows Pathtrust to be disabled at boot.  If this
	  option is set to 0 (zero), the Pathtrust kernel parameter will
	  default to 0, disabling Pathtrust at bootup.  If this option is
	  set to 1 (one), the Pathtrust kernel parameter will default to 1,
	  enabling Pathtrust at bootup. Defaults to 1.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer 1.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_DEVELOP
	bool "Pathtrust Development Support"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default n
	help
	  This enables the development support option of Pathtrust. This
	  enables you to toggle pathtrust between enabled (1) or disabled (0)
	  via /sys/kernel/security/pathtrust/enabled. Defaults to N.

config BBSECURE_PATHTRUST_SELINUX
	bool "Pathtrust SELinux Support"
	depends on BBSECURE_PATHTRUST
	default y
	help
	  This enables the selinux forbidden context support in pathtrust.
	  This feature enables one to load forbidden context domains which are
	  not allowed to execute files on untrusted filesystems. Defaults to Y.

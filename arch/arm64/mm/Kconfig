config STRICT_MEMORY_RWX
	bool "restrict kernel memory permissions as much as possible"
	help
	  If this is set, kernel text will be made RX, kernel data and stack
	  RW, rodata R (otherwise all of the kernel 1-to-1 mapping is
	  made RWX).
	  The tradeoff is that several sections are padded to
	  2M boundaries (because their permissions are different and
	  splitting the 2M pages into 4K ones causes TLB performance
	  problems), wasting memory.

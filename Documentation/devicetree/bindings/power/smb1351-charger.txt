Summit smb1351 battery charger

SMB1351 is a single-cell battery charger. It can charge
the battery and power the system via the USB/AC adapter input.

The smb1351 interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible			Must be "qcom,smb1351-charger".
- reg				The device 7-bit I2C address.

Required Properties for standalone charger:
- regulator-name		A string used as a descriptive name for OTG regulator.
- pinctrl-names			The state name of the pin configuration. Only
				support "default".
- pinctrl-0			The phandle of the pin configuration node in
				pinctrl for smb_int_pin.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ number of the GPIO
				connected to the STAT pin.
- qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma 	Fast Charging current in mA. Supported range is
				from 1000mA to 4500mA.
- qcom,chg-autonomous-mode	This is a bool property and it indicates that the
				charger is configured for autonomous operation and
				does not require any software configuration.
- qcom,disable-apsd		This is a bool property which disables automatic
				power source detection (APSD). If this is set
				charger detection is done by DCIN UV irq.
- qcom,charging-disabled	This is a bool property which disables charging.
- qcom,using-pmic-therm		This property indicates thermal pin connected to pmic or smb.
- qcom,bms-psy-name		This is a string and it points to the bms
				power supply name.
- qcom,use-external-fg		This is a bool property to indicate if the SMB charger
				working with an external Fuel Gauge(FG). If yes, the SMB
				charger would interact with FG and several software
				workarounds will be applied to improve the SoC reporting
				accuracy.
- qcom,resume-soc		This property specify an integer value to indicate
				SOC value to resume charging. This property could be
				defined when qcom,use-external-fg is defined. When this
				property is defined, recharging behavior will be based
				upon the SOC reported by FG and the recharging based on
				internal voltage will be disabled.
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate end-of-charge.
				Possible values in mA - 70, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700.
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This is a bool
				property.
- qcom,float-voltage-mv	 	Float Voltage in mV - the maximum voltage up to which
				the battery is charged. Supported range 3500mV to 4500mV
- qcom,recharge-mv		Recharge threshold in mV - the offset from the float-volatge
				as which the charger restarts charging. Possible
				values are 50mV and 100mV.
- qcom,recharge-disabled	Boolean value which disables the auto-recharge.
- qcom,bms-controlled-charging	This property enables BMS to control EOC and
				recharge. BMS and charger communicates with each
				other via power_supply framework. This
				property should be used with 'qcom,iterm-disabled'
				to ensure EOC detection in charger is disabled.
- qcom,force-hvdcp-2p0		Boolean value which allows to force hvdcp working on 2.0 mode.
- qcom,chg-vadc			Corresponding VADC device's phandle.
- qcom,chg-adc_tm		phandle to the corresponding VADC device to read the ADC channels.
- qcom,batt-cold-decidegc	Cold battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,batt-hot-decidegc	Hot battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,batt-missing-decidegc	This is a property indicating battery missing temperature, if
				higher than it, battery should exist.
- qcom,batt-warm-decidegc:	Warm battery temperature in decidegC. After hitting this threshold,
				"qcom,warm-bat-ma" defines maximum charging current and
				"qcom,warm-bat-mv" defines maximum target voltage.
- qcom,batt-cool-decidegc:       Cool battery temperature in decidegC. After hitting this threshold,
				"qcom,cool-bat-ma" defines maximum charging current and
				"qcom,cool-bat-mv" defines maximum target voltage.
- qcom,batt-warm-ma:		Maximum warm battery charge current in milli-amps.
- qcom,batt-cool-ma:		Maximum cool battery charge current in milli-amps.
- qcom,batt-warm-mv:		Maximum warm battery target voltage in milli-volts.
- qcom,batt-cool-mv:		Maximum cool battery target voltage in milli-volts.
- qcom,switch-freq:		Switching frequency of charger. Supported values:
				0 - 750 kHz, 1 - 1 MHz, 2 - 1.5 MHz, 3 - 3 MHz.
- qcom,parallel-usb-min-current-ma:
				Minimum current which has to be drawn from USB when
				acting as the primary charger before enabling the
				parallel slave.
				This property needs to be specified if it's acting as
				the primary charger in parallel charger configuration.
- qcom,parallel-usb-9v-min-current-ma:
				Minimum current which has to be drawn from USB when
				acting as the primary charger before enabling the
				parallel slave. This value applies only for 9V charger
				adapters.
				This property needs to be specified if it's acting as
				the primary charger in parallel charger configuration.
- qcom,parallel-usb-12v-min-current-ma:
				Minimum current which has to be drawn from USB when
				acting as the primary charger before enabling the
				parallel slave. This value applies only for 12V charger
				adapters.
				This property needs to be specified if it's acting as
				the primary charger in parallel charger configuration.
- qcom,parallel-allowed-lowering-ma:
				The acceptable current drop from the initial limit(ICL)
				to keep parallel charging active. If charging current
				drops below this threshold, parallel charging is
				disabled.
				This property needs to be specified if it's acting as
				the primary charger in parallel charger configuration.
- qcom,parallel-main-chg-fcc-percent:
				Percentage of the fast charge current allotted to the
				primary charger when parallel charging is enabled and
				operational.
				If this property is not defined, the driver defaults
				to a 50% : 50% split between the primary charger and the
				slave charger.
- qcom,parallel-main-chg-icl-percent:
				Percentage of the input current allotted to the primary
				charger when parallel charging is enabled and
				operational.
				If this property is not defined, the driver defaults to
				a 50% : 50% split between the primary charger and the
				slave charger.
- qcom,parallel-charger:	Boolean value to indicate if it's a slave charger in
				parallel charger configuration.
- qcom,parallel-en-pin-polarity:
				Specify the active polarity of enable pin of the slave
				charger in parallel charger configuration:
					0 - Active low
					1 - Active high.
				If not specified the default value is active-low.

* MCD (MobiCore Driver)

t-base is an operating system running in the secure world (TrustZone).
The t-base implementation consists of several components in the
secure world and the non-secure world (kernel and user space). The
MobiCore driver communicates with the t-base operating system that
exists in TrustZone.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "qcom,mcd"
  - qcom,ce-hw-instance: should contain crypto HW instance
  - qcom,ce-device: Device number
  - clocks: Array of <clock_controller_phandle clock_reference> listing
            all the clocks that are accesed by this subsystem.
  - qcom,ce-opp-freq: indicates the CE operating frequency in Hz, changes from target to target.

Example:
	mcd {
		compatible = "qcom,mcd";
		qcom,ce-hw-instance = <0>;
		qcom,ce-device = <0>;
		clocks = <&clock_gcc clk_crypto_clk_src>,
			 <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_crypto_clk>,
			 <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_crypto_ahb_clk>,
			 <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_crypto_axi_clk>;
		clock-names = "core_clk_src", "core_clk",
				"iface_clk", "bus_clk";
		qcom,ce-opp-freq = <100000000>;
	};

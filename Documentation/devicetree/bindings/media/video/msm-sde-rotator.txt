SDE Rotator

SDE rotator is a v4l2 rotator driver, which manages the rotator hw
block inside the Snapdragon Display Engine (or Mobile Display Subsystem)

Required properties
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,sde-rotator".
- reg:			offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names:		names to refer to register sets related to this device
- interrupt-parent:	phandle for the interrupt controller that
			services interrupts for this device.
- interrupts:		Interrupt associated with rotator.
- <name>-supply:	Phandle for <name> regulator device node.
- qcom,supply-names:	names to refer to regulator device node.
- clocks:		List of Phandles for clock device nodes
			needed by the device.
- clock-names:		List of clock names needed by the device.
Bus Scaling Data:
- qcom,msm-bus,name:		String property describing rotator client.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases:	This is the the number of Bus Scaling use cases
				defined in the vectors property. This must be
				set to <3> for rotator driver where use-case 0 is
				used to take off rotator BW votes from the system.
				And use-case 1 & 2 are used in ping-pong fashion
				to generate run-time BW requests.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths:	This represents the number of paths in each
				Bus Scaling Usecase. This value depends on
				how many number of AXI master ports are
				dedicated to rotator for particular chipset.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps:	* A series of 4 cell properties, with a format
				of (src, dst, ab, ib) which is defined at
				Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt
				* Current values of src & dst are defined at
				include/linux/msm-bus-board.h
				src values allowed for rotator are:
					25 = MSM_BUS_MASTER_ROTATOR
				dst values allowed for rotator are:
					512 = MSM_BUS_SLAVE_EBI_CH0
				ab: Represents aggregated bandwidth.
				ib: Represents instantaneous bandwidth.
				* Total number of 4 cell properties will be
				(number of use-cases * number of paths).
				* These values will be overridden by the driver
				based on the run-time requirements. So initial
				ab and ib values defined here are random and
				bare no logic except for the use-case 0 where ab
				and ib values needs to be 0.
				* Define realtime vector properties followed by
				non-realtime vector properties.

Optional properties
- qcom,rot-vbif-settings: 	Array with key-value pairs of constant VBIF register
				settings used to setup MDSS QoS for optimum performance.
				The key used should be offset from "rot_vbif_phys" register
				defined in reg property.
- qcom,mdss-rot-block-size:	This integer value indicates the size of a memory block
				(in pixels) to be used by the rotator. If this property
				is not specified, then a default value of 128 pixels
				would be used.
- qcom,mdss-highest-bank-bit:	This integer value indicate tile format as opposed to usual
				linear format. The value tells the GPU highest memory
				bank bit used.
- qcom,mdss-default-ot-wr-limit: This integer value indicates maximum number of pending
				writes that can be allowed on each WR xin.
				This value can be used to reduce the pending writes
				limit and can be tuned to match performance
				requirements depending upon system state.
				Some platforms require a dynamic ot limiting in
				some cases. Setting this default ot write limit
				will enable this dynamic limiting for the write
				operations in the platforms that require these
				limits.
- qcom,mdss-default-ot-rd-limit: This integer value indicates the default number of pending
				reads that can be allowed on each RD xin.
				Some platforms require a dynamic ot limiting in
				some cases. Setting this default ot read limit
				will enable this dynamic limiting for the read
				operations in the platforms that require these
				limits.
- qcom,mdss-rot-vbif-qos-setting: This array is used to program vbif qos remapper register
				  priority for rotator clients.
- qcom,mdss-rot-mode:		This is integer value indicates operation mode
				of the rotator device

Subnode properties:
- compatible:		Compatible name used in smmu v2.
			smmu_v2 names should be:
			"qcom,smmu_sde_rot_unsec"- smmu context bank device for
						unsecure rotation domain.
			"qcom,smmu_sde_rot_sec"	- smmu context bank device for
						secure rotation domain.
- iommus:		specifies the SID's used by this context bank
- gdsc-mdss-supply: 	Phandle for mdss supply regulator device node.
- clocks:		List of Phandles for clock device nodes
			needed by the device.
- clock-names:		List of clock names needed by the device.

ARM CPU memory latency monitor device

arm-memlat-mon is a device that represents the use of the PMU in ARM cores
to measure the parameters for latency driven memory access patterns.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,arm-memlat-mon"
- qcom,cpulist:			List of CPU phandles to be monitored in a cluster
- qcom,target-dev:		The DT device that corresponds to this master port
- qcom,core-dev-table:		A mapping table of core frequency to a required bandwidth vote at the
				given core frequency.

Example:
	qcom,arm-memlat-mon {
		compatible = "qcom,arm-memlat-mon";
		qcom,cpulist = <&CPU0 &CPU1>;
		qcom,target-dev = <&memlat0>;
		qcom,core-dev-table =
			<  300000 1525>,
			<  499200 3143>,
			< 1881600 5859>;
	};

Binding for Maxim MAX20010 regulator

MAX20010 is a synchronous step-down converter. It is able to deliver upto 6A
with 2 different programmable output voltages from 0.5V to 1.27V in 10mV steps
and from 0.625V to 1.5875V in 12.5mV steps. It supports synchronous
rectification and automatic PWM/PFM transitions.

The MAX20010 interface is via I2C bus.

Supported Properties
=======================

- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "maxim,max20010".

- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The device 8-bit I2C address.

- vin-supply
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: This is the phandle for the parent regulator. Typically used
		    for EN pin control of the buck.

- regulator-initial-mode
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The regulator operating mode. Should be either
		    "MAX20010_OPMODE_SYNC" or "MAX20010_OPMODE_FPWM".
		    These constants are defined in file
		    include/dt-bindings/regulator/max20010.h

- maxim,vrange-sel
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Integer value specifies the voltage range to be used.
		    Supported values are 0 or 1.
		    Value 0 supports voltage range from 0.5V to 1.27V in 10mV
		    steps. Value 1 supports voltage range from 0.625V to 1.5875V
		    in 12.5mV steps.

- maxim,soft-start-slew-rate
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: An integer value specifies the slew rate in uV/uS to be used
		    for soft-start operation of the buck. Supported values are
		    5500, 11000, 22000 and 44000.

- maxim,dvs-slew-rate
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: An integer value specifies the slew rate in uV/uS to be used
		    for buck dynamic voltage scaling operations. Supported
		    values are 5500, 11000, 22000 and 44000.

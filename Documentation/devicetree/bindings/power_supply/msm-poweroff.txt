MSM Restart Driver

A power supply hold (ps-hold) bit is set to power the msm chipsets.
Clearing that bit allows us to restart/poweroff. The difference
between poweroff and restart is determined by unique power manager IC
settings.

Required Properties:
-compatible: "qcom,pshold"
-reg: Specifies the physical address of the ps-hold register
      This value must correspond to "pshold-base" as defined in reg-names
-reg-names: must contain "pshold-base"
	    may also contain "tcsr-boot-misc-detect"

Optional Properties:
-reg: A secondary reg address/size pair may be provided, to specify the address
      of the TCSR_BOOT_MISC_DETECT register. This address is typically used to
      configure the type of reset desired. Omitting this address implies that
      the reset type shall be configured by means of a call to the secure
      environment. This value must correspond to "tcsr-boot-misc-detect" as
      defined in reg-names
-reg-names: must contain "tcsr-boot-misc-detect" if the secondary address/size
      pair described above is defined.

Example:

	restart@fc4ab000 {
		compatible = "qcom,pshold";
		reg = <0xfc4ab000 0x4>;
	};

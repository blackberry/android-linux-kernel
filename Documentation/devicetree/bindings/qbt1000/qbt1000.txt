* QBT1000 (Qualcomm Technologies Inc Ultra-Sonic Fingerprint Sensor)

1) Main node

   Required properties:
   - compatible : Should be "qcom,qbt1000"

2) Child nodes

   The main node must have one of the two possible child nodes which describes the
   properties of sensor connection.

   a) Sensor connected to SPI port :
   Node name - qcom,fingerprint-sensor-spi-conn

   Required properties:
   - clock-names : List of clock names that need to be voted on/off
   - clocks : Property pair that represents the clock controller and the clock
              id. This in combimination with the clock-name is used to obtain
              the handle for the clock that needs to be voted on/off
   - clock-frequency : Frequency of clock in Hz

   b) Sensor connected to SSC SPI port :
   Node name - qcom,fingerprint-sensor-ssc-spi-conn

   Required properties:
   - qcom,spi-port-id : SPI port id sensor is connected to
   - qcom,spi-port-slave-index : SPI port slave index
   - qcom,tz-subsys-id : TZ subsystem-id for SCM calls
   - qcom,ssc-subsys-id : SSC subsystem-id for SCM calls
   - clock-frequency : Frequency of clock in Hz

Examples:
        qcom,qbt1000 {
                compatible = "qcom,qbt1000";
                qcom,fingerprint-sensor-spi-conn {
                        clock-names = "spi_clk", "ahb_clk";
                        clocks = <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_blsp1_qup5_spi_apps_clk>,
                        <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_blsp1_ahb_clk>;
                        clock-frequency = <15000000>;
                };
        };

        qcom,qbt1000 {
                compatible = "qcom,qbt1000";
                qcom,fingerprint-sensor-ssc-spi-conn {
                        qcom,spi-port-id = <13>;
                        qcom,spi-port-slave-index = <0>;
                        qcom,tz-subsys-id = <1>;
                        qcom,ssc-subsys-id = <5>;
                        clock-frequency = <15000000>;
                };
        };

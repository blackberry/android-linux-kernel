MSM power device

msm_power is a device that monitors the frequency of various resources
(e.g. CPU and GPU) to manage other system resources (e.g. DDR frequency)
more efficiently.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,msm-power"
- clocks:		Array of clock phandle and clock specifier pairs
			(per clock-bindings doc) for all clocks that are
			to be managed by this device (e.g. GPU clock).

Example:
	qcom,msm-power {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-power";
		clock-names = "gpu_clk";
		clocks = <&clock_gpu clk_gpu_gx_gfx3d_clk>;
	};

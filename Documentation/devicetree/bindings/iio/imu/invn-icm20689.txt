The ICM20689 sensor is 6-axis gyroscope+accelerometer combo
device which is made by InvenSense Inc. It can be accessed
via SPI bus with max frequency up to 8MHz. The recommended
SPI mode is the mode 3(CPOL=1, CPHA=1).

The datasheet can be found as the following link:
https://www.invensense.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/icm-20689/


Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "invn,icm20689".
 - reg		: the Chip select ID.
 - spi-max-frequency: the SPI bus max frequency

Optional properties:
 - invn,icm20689-irq:  the irq gpio. This is not used if
 using SMD to trigger. this is needed only if using the
 device IRQ to trigger. Only using SMD to trigger can
 support 8K sample rate.

 - spi-cpol		: SPI MODE(CPOL)
 - spi-cpha		: SPI MODE(CPHA)

Example:
	spi@78b6000 {
		icm20689-spi@0 {
			compatible = "invn,icm20689";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <8000000>;
			invn,icm20689-irq = <&msm_gpio 96 0>;
			spi-cpol;
			spi-cpha;
		};
	};

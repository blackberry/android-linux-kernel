MCU time sync driver is used for communicating with customer board, it using GPIO to trigger customer board. At the same time, to record currenct cpu time.


Required properties:
 - compatible        : Should be "qcom,mcu-time-sync".
 - qcom,mcu-link-gpio : the conenct gpio.

Example:
	qcom,mcu_time_sync {
		compatible = "qcom,mcu-time-sync";
		qcom,mcu-link-gpio = <&msm_gpio 90 1>;
	};

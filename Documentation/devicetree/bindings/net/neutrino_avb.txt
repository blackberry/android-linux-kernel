* Neutrino Ethernet *

This driver implements Ethernet driver for Neutrino ethernet controller

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be "qcom,ntn_avb"
  - ntn-rst-delay-msec: delay (msec) required after PCIe reset for stabilization
  - ntn-rc-num: PCIe root complex number on which Neutrino is connected

Optional properties:
  - ntn-bus-num: PCIe bus number on which Neutrino is connected
  - ntn-rst-gpio: Neutrino reset GPIO
  - vdd-ntn-hsic-supply: Neutrino HSIC power supply
  - vdd-ntn-pci-supply: PCIe core power supply
  - vdd-ntn-io-supply: Neutrino IO power supply
  - vdd-ntn-phy-supply: Ethernet PHY power supply
  - vdd-ntn-core-supply: Neutrino core power supply
  - ntn-supply-enable-gpio: GPIO used to control power supply to Neutrino
  - qcom,ntn-fw-load-delay-msec: Delay used after loading the firmware to SRAM
  - qcom,ntn-pcierst-resx: PCIe reset is connected to Neutrino RESX, this
			   means that Neutrino will stay on reset during
			   PCIe suspend
  - qcom,ntn-disable-phy: Use for devices that don't have a PHY chip
  - qcom,ntn-timestamp-valid-window: If the timestamp in the AVTP packet is
			   between the current time and the current time plus
			   the timestamp valid window, Neutrino will hold the
			   packet until the timestamp elapses. Otherwise, the
			   packet is sent immediately. Each unit is 2^24 ns,
			   or approx 16.8 ms. For example, a value of 4 would
			   mean a timestamp valid window of approximately 67
			   ms.
  - qcom,ntn-rmii-mode: Use to select if RMII mode is enabled. The interface
			   selection pin is not brought out so it has to be
			   forced. If this option is omitted then RGMII mode
			   will be used. Use 0 to disable and 1 to enable.
  - qcom,ntn-phy-addr: Neutrino PHY address.

Example:
	qcom,ntn_avb {
		compatible = "qcom,ntn_avb";
		ntn-rst-gpio = <&pm8994_gpios 13 0>;
		vdd-ntn-hsic-supply = <&pm8994_l25>;
		vdd-ntn-pci-supply = <&pm8994_s4>;
		vdd-ntn-io-supply = <&pm8994_s4>;
		vdd-ntn-phy-supply = <&pm8994_l9>;
		vdd-ntn-core-supply = <&pm8994_l19>;
		qcom,ntn-rst-delay-msec = <100>;
		qcom,ntn-rc-num = <1>;
		qcom,ntn-bus-num = <1>;
		qcom,ntn-phy-addr = <7>;
	};

	ethernet {
		compatible = "qcom,ntn_avb";
		ntn-supply-enable-gpio = <&pmd9635_gpios 3 0>;
		qcom,ntn-rst-delay-msec = <100>;
		qcom,ntn-rc-num = <1>;
		qcom,ntn-fw-load-delay-msec = <200>;
		qcom,ntn-pcierst-resx;
		qcom,ntn-timestamp-valid-window = <4>; /* 4 is approx 67 ms */
		qcom,ntn-rmii-mode = <0>; /* RMII mode is disabled, use RGMII */
	};

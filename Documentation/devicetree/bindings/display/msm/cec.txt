Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CEC device

CEC is a protocol that provides high-level control functions between all of the
various audiovisual products in a user environment.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "qcom,hdmi-cec".
- qcom,hdmi-dev: Phandle for the hdmi device node.
- interrupt-parent: Must be the hdmi interrupt controller.
- interrupts: Interrupt associated with cec.
- reg: Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.
- reg-names: "hdmi_cec".
- clocks: List of Phandles for clock device nodes needed by the device.
- clock-names: List of clock names needed by the device.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only two values: "cec_active" and "cec_sleep" which stands for the
		active and sleep state of pinctrl used in this CEC driver.
- pinctrl-0: The active pinctrl state which is a list of phandles pointing to a pin configuration node.
- pinctrl-1: The sleep pinctrl state which is a list of phandles pointing to a pin configuration node.
- cec-gdsc-supply: Phandle for cec gdsc supply regulator device node.
- qcom,platform-supply-entries: A sub node that lists the elements of the supply. There can be more
				than one instance of this binding, in which case the entry would be
				appended with the supply entry index. e.g. qcom,platform-supply-entry@0.
				-- reg: offset and length of the register set for the device.
				-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio).
				-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV).
				-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV).
				-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply.
				-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply.


Optional properties:
- qcom,platform-supply-entries: A sub node that lists the elements of the supply. There can be more
				than one instance of this binding, in which case the entry would be
				appended with the supply entry index. e.g. qcom,platform-supply-entry@0.
				-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on.
				-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on.
				-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off.
				-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off.

Example:

sde_hdmi_cec: qcom,hdmi-cec@c9a0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,hdmi-cec";
	label = "sde_hdmi_cec";
	qcom,hdmi-dev = <&sde_hdmi>;
	interrupt-parent = <&sde_hdmi_tx>;
	interrupts = <1 0>;

	reg = <0xc9a0000 0x50c>;
	reg-names = "hdmi_cec";

	clocks = <&clock_mmss clk_mmss_mnoc_ahb_clk>,
	       <&clock_mmss clk_mmss_mdss_ahb_clk>,
	       <&clock_mmss clk_mmss_mdss_hdmi_clk>;
	clock-names = "cec_mnoc_clk", "cec_iface_clk", "cec_core_clk";

	pinctrl-names = "cec_active", "cec_sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&mdss_hdmi_cec_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&mdss_hdmi_cec_suspend>;

	cec-gdsc-supply = <&gdsc_mdss>;
	qcom,platform-supply-entries {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		qcom,platform-supply-entry@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			qcom,supply-name = "cec-gdsc";
			qcom,supply-min-voltage = <0>;
			qcom,supply-max-voltage = <0>;
			qcom,supply-enable-load = <0>;
			qcom,supply-disable-load = <0>;
		};
	};
};

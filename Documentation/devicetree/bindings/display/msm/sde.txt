Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SDE KMS

Snapdragon Display Engine implements Linux DRM/KMS APIs to drive user
interface to different panel interfaces. SDE driver is the core of
display subsystem which manage all data paths to different panel interfaces.

Required properties
- compatible: Must be "qcom,sde-kms"
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names : Names to refer to register sets related to this device
- clocks: List of Phandles for clock device nodes
    needed by the device.
- clock-names: List of clock names needed by the device.
- mmagic-supply: Phandle for mmagic mdss supply regulator device node.
- vdd-supply: Phandle for vdd regulator device node.
- interrupt-parent: Must be core interrupt controller.
- interrupts: Interrupt associated with MDSS.
- interrupt-controller: Mark the device node as an interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Should be one. The first cell is interrupt number.
- iommus: Specifies the SID's used by this context bank.

Please refer to ../../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for a general
description of interrupt bindings.

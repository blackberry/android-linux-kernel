In Rush Current Mitigation driver:

On recent targets, APSS L2 memories are moved to APC domain which were
earlier on Mx domain. Analysis suggests that on current targets APSS L2
memories provide reverse capacitance on Mx and this used to provide buffer
while powering ON Q6 L2. Now due to L2s moving to APC, the cushion is not
available. So there is a chance of droop when Q6 L2 memories are being
powered up.

During Q6 low power modes L2 is kept in retention only and never collapsed. So
the cases where it needs to be taken care is during PIL(modem and adsp bringup
during boot). So in cold boot path before bringing up modem or adsp, turn on MM
memories. Hence providing a intermediate load.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be qcom,msm-inrush-current-mitigation
- qcom,dependent-subsystems:	List of subsystems which need the intermediate load
- vdd-supply:			gdsc handle to switch on memory.

Example:
	qcom,inrush-current {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-inrush-current-mitigation";
		qcom,dependent-subsystems = "modem", "adsp";
		vdd-supply = <&gdsc_mdss>;
	};

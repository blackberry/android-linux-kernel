* msm-adsp-loader

Required properties:
 - compatible : "qcom,adsp-loader"
 - qcom,adsp-state:
	It is possible that some MSM use PIL to load the ADSP image. While
	other MSM may use SBL to load the ADSP image at boot. Audio APR needs
	state of ADSP to register and enable APR to be used for sending commands
	to ADSP. so adsp-state represents the state of ADSP to ADSP loader.
	Value of 0 indicates ADSP loader needs to use PIL and value of 2 means
	ADSP image is already loaded by SBL.

Optional properties:
 - qcom,proc-img-to-load;
	This property can be used to override default ADSP
	loading by PIL. Based on string input, different proc is
	loaded. Right now we are adding option "modem"
	for 8916 purpose. Default image will be "adsp" which
	will load LPASS Q6 for other targets as expected.
	"adsp" option need not be explicitly mentioned in
	DTSI file, as it is default option.

Example:

qcom,msm-adsp-loader {
	compatible = "qcom,adsp-loader";
	qcom,adsp-state = <2>;
	qcom,proc-img-to-load = "modem";
};

* msm-audio-ion

Required properties:
 - compatible : "qcom,msm-audio-ion"

Optional properties:
 - qcom,smmu-version:
	version ID to provide info regarding smmu version
	used in chipset. If ARM SMMU HW - use id value as 1,
	If QSMMU HW - use id value as 2.

 - qcom,smmu-enabled:
        It is possible that some MSM have SMMU in ADSP.  While other MSM use
	no SMMU. Audio lib introduce wrapper for ION APIs. The wrapper needs
        presence of SMMU in ADSP to handle ION APIs differently.
        Presence of this property means ADSP has SMMU in it.
 - iommus:
	A phandle parsed by smmu driver. Number of entries will vary across
	targets.

 - qcom,scm-mp-enabled:
	It is possible that some MDMs need audio memory protection enabled
	through SMC ID in TZ. To enable this functionality, this flag
	should be present. Presence of this flag makes the msm-audio-ion
	driver call SCM driver API for memory protection.

 - memory-region:
	Provide reference to memory region allocated for audio in
	reserved-memory node.

Example:

qcom,msm-audio-ion {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-audio-ion;
	qcom,smmu-enabled;
	qcom,scm-mp-enabled;
	memory-region = <&audio_mem>;

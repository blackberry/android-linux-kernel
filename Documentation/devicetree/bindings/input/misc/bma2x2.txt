BOSCH bma2x2 3-axis accelerometer sensor driver.

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "bosch,bma2x2".
 - reg			: i2c slave address of the device.
 - pinctrl-names	: Pinctrl configuration names of this sensor driver.
				Should be "default".
 - pinctrl-0		: The pinctrl node corresponding to "default",
				should be <&bma2x2_int1_default &bma2x2_int2_default>.
 - interrupt-parent	: Parent of interrupt.
 - interrupts		: Accelerometer interrupts to indicate new data ready or events.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and I2C.
 - bosch,init-interval	: Initial data polling interval in millisecond.
 - bosch,place		: The placing of the accelerometer on board. There are 8
				patterns of placing described as below:
				0: 1st pin is right down
				1: 1st pin is left down
				2: 1st pin is left top
				3: 1st pin is right top
				4: 1st pin is left down (from top view)
				5: 1st pin is left top (from top view)
				6: 1st pin is right top (from top view)
				7: 1st pin is right down (from top view)

Optional properties:

 - bosch,gpio-int1	: 1st irq gpio which is to provide interrupts
				to host, interrupt events can be route to any of
				these two irq pins according device configuration.
 - bosch,gpio-int2	: 2nd irq gpio which is to provide interrupts
				to host.
 - bosch,use-interrupt	: Use device interrupt to trigger data acquisition
				instead of polling data.
 - bosch,use-int2	: Map interrupt signal to 2nd interrupt pin of device.
				If this property is defined, data ready, fifo full and
				other event will trigger level change on interrupt pin2
				instead of interrupt pin1.
 - bosch,use-smd	: enable signification motion detection(SMD). Enable this
				will create a new sensor which triggers an event each time
				significant motion is detected.
 - bosch,use-hrtimer	: Use hrtimer to report data. Hrtimer can report data more timely.

Example:
&i2c_0 { /* BLSP1 QUP2 */
	 bosch@18 { /* Accelerometer sensor */
		compatible = "bosch,bma2x2";
		reg = <0x18>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&bma2x2_int1_default &bma2x2_int2_default>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msm_gpio>;
		interrupts = <112 0x2002>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8916_l17>;
		vio-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;
		bosch,init-interval = <200>;
		bosch,place = <1>;
		bosch,gpio-int1 = <&msm_gpio 112 0x2002>;
		bosch,gpio-int2 = <&msm_gpio 114 0x2002>;
	};
};

Platform device for Host Based Touch Processing (HBTP)

hbtp_input is a kernel driver that provides functionality needed by
Host Based Touch Processing (HBTP) from the kernel. One of the
functionality is to manage the power source for touch Analog Front
End (AFE).

Required properties:

 - compatible		: should be "qcom,hbtp-input"

Optional properties:

 - vcc_ana-supply	: Analog power supply needed to power device
 - qcom,afe-load	: AFE load in uA
 - qcom,afe-vtg-min	: AFE minimum voltage in uV
 - qcom,afe-vtg-max	: AFE maximum voltage in uV

Example:
	&soc {
		hbtp {
			compatible = "qcom,hbtp-input";
			vcc_ana-supply = <&pm8941_l18>;
			qcom,afe-load = <150000>;
			qcom,afe-vtg-min = <2700000>;
			qcom,afe-vtg-max = <3300000>;
		};
	};

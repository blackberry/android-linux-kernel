AKM AK09911 3-axis electronic compass driver

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "ak,ak09911" or "akm,akm09911".
 - reg				: i2c address of the device.
 - pinctrl-names	: The pinctrl configration names of this sensor driver. Should be "default","reset".
 - pinctrl-0		: The pinctrl node corresponding to "default", should be <&akm_default>.
 - pinctrl-1		: The pinctrl node corresponding to "reset", should be <&akm_reset>.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power up the device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and I2C.
 - akm,layout		: The layout of the ecompass sensor chip. There are 8
	patterns of layout described as below:
	0: Indicate the invalid pattern, The userspace will decide the pattern.
	1: 1st pin is right down
	2: 1st pin is left down
	3: 1st pin is left top
	4: 1st pin is right top
	5: 1st pin is left down (from top view)
	6: 1st pin is left top (from top view)
	7: 1st pin is right top (from top view)
	8: 1st pin is right down (from top view)
 - akm,gpio_rstn	: The gpio pin to reset the sensor chip.

Optional properites:

 - akm,auto-report	: Enable auto-report mode.
 - akm,use-hrtimer	: Enable the hrtimer mode. The hrtimer will be used as the poling
	 delay timer, and high priority workqueue will be used in order to get a more stable polling interval.

 Example:
	akm@c {
			compatible = "ak,ak09911";
			reg = <0x0c>;
			pinctrl-names = "default","reset";
			pinctrl-0 = <&akm_default>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&akm_reset>;
			vdd-supply = <&pm8110_l19>;
			vio-supply = <&pm8110_l14>;
			akm,layout = <0x0>;
			akm,gpio_rstn = <&msmgpio 82 0x0>;
			akm,auto-report;
	};

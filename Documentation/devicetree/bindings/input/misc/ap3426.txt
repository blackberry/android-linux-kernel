AP3426 3-in-1 digital ALS+PS+IRLED module

AP3426 is a module integrated with a digital ambient light sensor, a proximity
sensor, and an IR LED in a single package. It provides multiple gain ambient
light detection as well as external object distance detection. It can be
connected to host processor via i2c.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "di,ap3426".
 - reg			: i2c slave address of this device.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power up this device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and i2c.
 - interrupt-parent	: The interrupt controller this device connected to.
 - interrupts		: L/P sample interrupt to indicate new data ready.
 - pinctrl-names	: pinctrl configuration names of this device. Should be "default" and "sleep".
 - pinctrl-0		: Should specify pin control groups used for this sensor.
 - pinctrl-1		: Should specify pin control groups used for this sensor.
 - di,irq-gpio		: GPIO pin for interrupt of this device.
 - di,als-cal		: Coefficient to calibrate this device for specific board.
 - di,als-gain		: Default als gain configuration for the device. 0 for 32768,
		1 for 8192, 2 for 2048 and 3 for 512.
 - di,als-persist	: Interrupt persist configuration for the device. It indicates
		how much conversion cycles will trigger ALS interrupt. The maximum value
		is 63.
 - di,ps-led-driver	: Specifies proximity LED driver ratio based on 140mA of this device.
		0 for 16.7%, 1 for 33.3%, 2 for 66.7% and 3 for 100%.
 - di,ps-mean-time	: Configures response time of proximity detection cycle. 0 for conversion
		time 5ms, 1 for conversion time 9.6ms, 2 for conversion time 14.1ms and 3 for
		conversion time 18.7ms.
 - di,ps-integrated-time: Selects the duration at which the device's ADC will sample the
		photodiode current signal. The maximum value is 63.


Optional properties:
 - di,ps-distance-table	: Calibrated ADC value of proximity sensor to indicate the distance of
		the object in centimeter. The value in this table should in descend order and the
		maximum value is 1023. Use default value if not exist.
 - di,als-sensitivity	: Ambient light sensitivity in lux. This array configures how much light
		intensity change will trigger a light sensor event. The array size should be 4.
 - di,wakeup-threshold	: This value configures the threshold in centimeter that can wake up
		SoC when system is suspended. This value should between 0 and
		ARRAY_SIZE(di,ps-distance-table).

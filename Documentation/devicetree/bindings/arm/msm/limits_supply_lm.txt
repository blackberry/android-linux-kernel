PMIC supply(S1) current limiting driver(SUPPLY_LM)
=====================================

This driver is a current limit management module to help manage
instantaneous peak current drawn by multiple subsystems on shared
supply. The inputs to the mitigation algorithm are current states
of different subsystems sharing this supply like cpu frequency,
gpu frequency, number of cores online, soc temperature, core leakage,
and modem state. It throttles cpu frequency and limits number of
online cores to reduce the dynamic current so as to keep the total
current drawn from supply in safe limits.

The device tree parameters for SUPPLY_LM driver are:

Required parameters:
- compatible :	Must be "qcom,supply-lm"
- interrupts :	SUPPLY_LM modem to apps interrupt details.
- reg :         Base addresses of the SUPPLY_LM modem interrupt data and
		its size in bytes.
- reg-names :   Name of SUPPLY_LM modem register in reg node.
- qcom,supply-lm-very-hot-temp-range : SUPPLY_LM very hot temperature range
		info. It expects trigger and clear thresholds in order.
- qcom,supply-lm-hot-temp-range : SUPPLY_LM hot temperature range info.
		It expects trigger and clear thresholds in order.
- gpu-dev-opp:	Phandle for gpu dev.
Example:

	qcom,supply-lm {
		compatible = "qcom,supply-lm";
		interrupts = <0 133 4>;
		reg =	<0x01946000 0x8>; /* TCSR_TCSR_S1LM_MODEM_TO_APPS_INT and
					   * TCSR_TCSR_S1LM_MODEM_TO_APPS_INT_DATA */
		reg-names = "intr_reg";
		qcom,supply-lm-very-hot-temp-range = <75 72>;
		qcom,supply-lm-hot-temp-range = <65 62>;
		gpu-dev-opp = <&msm_gpu>;
	};

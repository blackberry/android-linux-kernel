This driver is intended to handle any changes related to power management clocks.
Registers with CPU PM notification call back to handle bimc/apss hardware clock gating.

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,clock-pm"

Optional properties

- clocks: clock identifers used by clock driver while looking up apss clocks.
- clock-names: name of the clock used by the driver.

[Example dts]

qcom,clock-pm {
	compatible = "qcom,clock-pm";
		clocks = <&clock_gcc clk_apss_axi_clk_sleep>,
				<&clock_gcc clk_bimc_apss_axi_clk_sleep>;
		clock-names = "apss_axi", "bimc_apss_axi";
};

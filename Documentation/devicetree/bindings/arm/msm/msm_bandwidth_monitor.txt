Bandwidth Monitor driver(BW_MONITOR)
=====================================

Bandwidth Monitor driver creates logical sensor nodes with thermal core
framework for the specified bus. This logical sensor will be used to monitor
and mitigate the bus bandwidth. This driver can be configured to register
any bus bandwidth as a sensor for it to be monitored.

The device tree parameters for bandwidth monitor driver(BW_MONITOR) driver are:

Properties:

- compatible:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <string>
        Definition: shall be "qcom,bm-sensors"

- <child node>
        Usage: required
        Definition: Each child node represents a bandwidth sensor and name of
			the node will be used as bandwidth sensor name. Each
			sensor can represent either single bus bandwidth or
			aggregation of multiple bus bandwidth.

Child node Properties:
- qcom,bm-sensor:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <array of phandle>
        Definition: This bandwidth sensor monitors aggregated bandwidth of
			these bus bandwidth.

- qcom,bm-sensor-field:
        Usage: required
        Value type: <string>
	Definition: This property defines the bandwidth to be monitored,
			either average bandwidth(ab) or instantaneous
			bandwidth(ib).

Example:
	qcom,bm-sensors {
		compatible = "qcom,bm-sensors";

		bw_mm {
			qcom,bm-sensor = <&slv_snoc_bimc_0 &slv_snoc_bimc_2>;
			qcom,bm-sensor-field = "ab";
		};

		bw_apps {
			qcom,bm-sensor = <&mas_apps_proc>;
			qcom,bm-sensor-field = "ib";
		};
	};

* RPM Rail Stats

RPM maintains rail and corner data in the RPM RAM. A device tree node
will hold the address of the RPM RAM from where rail stats are read.

RPM maintains free heap space availability in the RPM RAM. RPM free heap
space value is required for debugging purpose.

The required properties for rpm-rail-stats are:

- compatible: "qcom,rpm-rail-stats"
- reg: The address on the RPM RAM from where stats are read.

	Second register specifies the offset of the rpm rail
	stats start address pointer.

- reg-names: Name of the register holding address.

Example:

qcom,rpm-stats@200000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpm-stats";
		reg = <0x200000 0x100>,
			<0x290000 0x4>;
		reg-names = "phys_addr_base",
				"offset_addr"
};

ADV7481 chip driver (VIDEO_ADV7481)

VIDEO_ADV7481 is a kernel platform driver that is used for video decoder
and dual mode HDMI/MHL receiver.

The devicetree representation of the VIDEO_ADV7481 block should be:

Required properties

- compatible: "qcom,adv7481"
- reg: The i2c slave address of adv7481 device.
- qcom,cci-master: The i2c master id to be used for adv7481 driver.
- gpios: The GPIOs required to be configured for the driver. It should
	be in the order I2C data line, i2c clock line, reset line,
	interrupt 1, interrupt 2 and interrupt 3.
- cam_vdig-supply: Should contain regulator to be used for the digital
	vdd.
- cam_vio-supply: Should contain regulator to be used for the IO vdd.
- cam_vana-supply: Should contain regulator from which analog voltage
	is supplied.
- qcom,cam-vreg-name: Should specify array of regulator names required
	for the device.
- qcom,cam-vreg-min-voltage: Should specify array of minimum voltage
	level in uV for the regulators specified in the property
	"qcom,cam-vreg-name".
- qcom,cam-vreg-max-voltage: Should specify array of maximum voltage
	level in uV for the regulators specified in the property
	"qcom,cam-vreg-name".
- qcom,cam-vreg-op-mode: Should specify array of current level in uA
	for the regulators specified in the property "qcom,cam-vreg-name".

		compatible = "qcom,adv7481";
		reg = <0x70 0xff>;
		cam_vdig-supply = <&vph_pwr_vreg>;
		/* Cameras powered by PMIC: */
		cam_vio-supply = <&pm8994_lvs1>;
		cam_vana-supply = <&pm8994_l17>;
		/* Self-powered cameras: */
		qcom,cam-vreg-name = "cam_vdig", "cam_vio", "cam_vana";
		qcom,cam-vreg-min-voltage = <1300000 0 2500000>;
		qcom,cam-vreg-max-voltage = <1300000 0 2500000>;
		qcom,cam-vreg-op-mode = <105000 0 80000>;
		qcom,cci-master = <0>;
		qcom,slave-addr = <0x70>;
		gpios = <&tlmm 17 0>,          /* I2C SDA */
			<&tlmm 18 0>,          /* I2C SCL */
			<&pm8994_gpios 4 0>,   /* RST     */

Qualcomm CPU clock Ramp Controller

The root clock generator could have the ramp controller in built.
Ramp control will allow programming the sequence ID for pulse swallowing,
enable sequence and for linking sequence IDs.

This will use the cpu clock device node.

Required properties:
- reg:			Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
			memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:		Names of the bases for the above registers. Expected
			bases are:
			"rcgwr-cX-base" (X: 0 or 1 based on the number of
			clusters)
- qcom,num-clusters:	Number of clusters which support RCGwR.

Optional Properties:
- qcom,lmh-sid-cX:	List of LMH SID offset and value to be programmed for
			each cluster (X: 0 or 1)
- qcom,link-sid-cX:	List of Link SID offset and value to be programmed for
			each cluster (X: 0 or 1)
- qcom,dfs-sid-cX:	List of DFS SID offset and value to be programmed for
			each cluster (X: 0 or 1)
- qcom,ramp-dis-cX:	Boolean property to disable ramp down for each cluster
			(X: 0 or 1)

Example:
        clock_cpu: qcom,cpu-clock@b016000 {
                compatible = "qcom,cpu-clock";
		qcom,num-clusters = <2>;
		qcom,lmh-sid-c0  = < 0x30 0x077706db>,
				   < 0x34 0x05550249>,
				   < 0x38 0x00000111>;
		qcom,lmh-sid-c1  = < 0x30 0x077706db>,
				   < 0x34 0x05550249>,
				   < 0x38 0x00000111>;
                reg = <0xb114000 0x68>,
		      <0xb014000 0x68>;
                reg-names = "rcgwr-c0-base", "rcgwr-c1-base";
                #clock-cells = <1>;
};

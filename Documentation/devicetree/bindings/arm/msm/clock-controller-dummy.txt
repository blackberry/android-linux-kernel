Qualcomm MSM Dummy Clock controller

Qualcomm MSM Dummy Clock controller devices provide a dummy clock for driver
development during pre-silicon stage. The driver will always return a dummy
clock that has no effect on hardware.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,dummycc"
- #clock_cells:		Must be <1>. This will allow the common clock device
			tree framework to recognize _this_ device node as a
			clock provider.
Optional properties:
- #reset-cells:		Must be <1>. This will allow the common reset device
			tree framework to recognize _this_ device node as a
			reset controller provider.

Example:
	clock_rpm: qcom,rpmcc {
		compatible = "qcom,dummycc";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

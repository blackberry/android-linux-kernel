	  Enables kernel address sanitizer - runtime memory debugger,
	  designed to find out-of-bounds accesses and use-after-free bugs.
	  This is strictly a debugging feature and it requires a gcc version
	  of 4.9.2 or later. Detection of out of bounds accesses to stack or
	  global variables requires gcc 5.0 or later.
	  This feature consumes about 1/8 of available memory and brings about
	  ~x3 performance slowdown.
	  For better error detection enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE.
	  See KASAN_SANITIZE_ALL for selectively compiling files and directories
	  with this compiler feature enabled.

config KASAN_OUTLINE
	bool "Outline instrumentation"
	help
	  Before every memory access compiler insert function call
	  __asan_load*/__asan_store*. These functions performs check
	  of shadow memory. This is slower than inline instrumentation,
	  however it doesn't bloat size of kernel's .text section so
	  much as inline does.

config KASAN_INLINE
	bool "Inline instrumentation"
	help
	  Compiler directly inserts code checking shadow memory before
	  memory accesses. This is faster than outline (in some workloads
	  it gives about x2 boost over outline instrumentation), but
	  make kernel's .text size much bigger.
	  This requires a gcc version of 5.0 or later.
